export const longText = "To learn more about how hardware and software components work together across the Internet, I decided to take an IoT course, which involved working with an Arduino UNO, sensors, and cloud services. I enjoyed learning about how to work with hardware (I even learned how to solder) and connect wires to different components. For my final project, I built an exercise tracker called Fit Buddy that uses an accelerometer and a wifi module to keep track of the user's exercise time and step count as well as provide analysis to help them improve and reach their goals. The wifi module sends the data collected from the sensors to an AWS EC2 instance and then stores it in a Postgres database. Then, I pull the data into a data visualization and analysis tool called Dataiku to create some graphs and give the user insight into how their exercise duration and step count has changed over time and whether they are meeting their goals. This project was a great way to get hands-on experience working with IoT devices and create an interesting, meaningful product.";
