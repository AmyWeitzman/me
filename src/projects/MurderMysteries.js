export const longText = "Murder Mysteries was a game I created for my family to play that involves just what it sounds like, a murder mystery. A few weeks ahead of time, I come up with the theme and begin designing the storyline, characters, clues, and, most importantly, the menu. Then, I send an email to the participants (my family) about the event, including the date, time, and the character everyone will be portraying. On the night of the event, my family shows up, dressed in outrageous costumes with amazing props, and we have dinner while solving a murder mystery. It is a lot of fun to play and my family always puts so much effort into making their costumes and props. It's a great way for my family to connect and enjoy each other's company.";
