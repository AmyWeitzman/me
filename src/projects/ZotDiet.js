We integrated the Spoonacular API to generate meal plans based on the user's personal profile, allergies, and food preferences. One of my tasks was developing an algorithm for the meal liking/disliking system to allow users to provide feedback and receive more customized meal recommendations. I also incorporated natural language processing techniques to standardize data and make the meal ranking algorithm more efficient. Overall, as a team, we were able to create a viable product over the course of 10 weeks.";
