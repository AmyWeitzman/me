Fortunately, an organization I am a part of called Rewriting the Code, which supports college women in tech, decided to develop a mini-internship program for those members whose internships were cancelled due to the pandemic. I was placed on the Job Board Data Collection team along with 5 other students. Our task was to design a job board for RTC members to more easily find and track internship and job opportunities from RTC's partner companies and then collect data to give RTC leadership actionable insight into how RTC members are using the job board and how it could be improved. Over the course of the 8 week project, our team developed a Figma prototype of the Job Board Analytics Dashboard that included in-depth, customizable analysis for RTC to review. This project was fun to work on because I learned how to use Figma and got to work with a group of amazing women from all over the country.";
