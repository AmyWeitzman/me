export const longText = "I grew up playing the Game of Life, but now that I'm older, I realize how unrealistic much of that game is so I decided to make a more realistic verison called Real Life. Complete with job, house, cars, families, and yearly expenses, the game encompasses much of the different paths, decisions, hardships, and opportunities of real life. Spanning ages 18 to 65, people can choose their path, whether it be going to college (and incurring a lot of debt, of course), joining the military (with great benefits), buying a house and car, having kids, traveling, investing, and much more. You earn (and lose) points for the decisions you make as well as random things life throws at you. The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end. The great thing is that there are so many ways the game could turn out, my family can play it again and again and each game will be unique.";
