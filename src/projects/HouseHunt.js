export const longText = "Being stuck at home in quarantine, playing games so much they became boring, and not being as active outdoors, I decided to make a real-life Scattergories game called House Hunt that my family could play to have fun and stay in shape. Using our phones, we text a phone number to join the game and then receive a text message with a list of categories and a letter. Everyone then runs around the house, searching for objects that fit the category and start with the letter. When we find objects, we take a picture and send it to the phone number. The data is stored and when the game is over, it is fed to a website I built where we can see everyone's results and give out points for unique responses. The back-end and data processing were built with Python and the Twilio API, and the front-end website was built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was project was fun since it was my first time using an API and it was great that my family could play together.";
